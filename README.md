# Assignment 1 â€“ Operating Systems Programming Lab

This repository contains my university assignment.

The assignment focuses on building a simulation in C++ with multiple entities  
(Facilities, Settlements, Plans) and different selection policies.  
It was an instructive experience writing a structured project with separate headers,  
source files, and a `makefile`.

---

## Project Overview
- Language: C++
- Build System: `make`
- Structure: `include/` (headers), `src/` (implementation), `makefile` (build script)
- Input/Output: The program simulates a scenario described in the assignment specifications,  
  processing commands and generating outputs according to rules of facilities, plans, and policies.

## Learning Goals
- Gaining hands-on experience with:
  - C++ object-oriented programming (classes, headers, inheritance).
  - Working with multiple source files and modular project design.
  - Using a `makefile` for compilation.
  - Handling simulation logic and decision-making with policies.
- Understanding how to transform assignment specifications into working code.

## Build & Run

To build the project:
```bash
make
